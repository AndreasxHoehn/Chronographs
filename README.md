Using Sequence Analysis Results to Create ggplot2-based Plots and Estimate 95% CIs

# About
* This is a small working example of a sequence analysis using the TraMineR Package
* We first run a simple example analysis.
* We then extract raw sequence data from objects created during sequence analysis with the TraMineR package and bring these data into the correct format
* We then estimate 95% CIs for the fraction of sequences
* We then visualize our results using ggplot2

# Requirements
* Ensure all required libraries are installed (L18-L25) and there is no need to specify a working directory
